# Social-Network-Analysis

The intent of this code is to create something that will look through tweets via keywords, and see the amount of likes a tweet has. 
The logic behind this is that not everyone has the time in the day to tweet, so will often leave likes, or possibly retweet. 
This has been made with the intent to track the likes and see if the keyword has a growing trend besides the amount of tweets. 
Over the past few weeks, I have been working on some code – albeit incomplete – to accommodate for that idea. 

Current Issues:
- Tweepy requires authentication/product keys, which I will need to get.
- Tweepy does not have a feature to check for likes. Some fiddling with features is required.
- Geo is useful, but will require me to download the package.
- Fully understanding Tweepy Functions.
